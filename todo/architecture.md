# Self-Hosted Performance Redesign — Architecture Strategy

**Date:** 2026-03-29  
**Meeting:** CEO, Architect, Lead Engineer, QA  
**Problem:** Self-hosted mode on Raspberry Pi has 2-3+ second load delays on page reload. Customers reverting to Firebase mode.  
**Scope:** Self-hosted (CouchDB/backend) only. Firebase mode is performant — no changes unless a shared refactor makes sense to do in one go.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 The Core Problem: 19 Individual HTTP Requests on Every Page Load

When the app loads (or user tabs back), `AppDataService.loadFromDB()` fires **19 parallel HTTP requests** to the backend:

| #   | Endpoint                                   | Data               | Used By                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `/api/data/read/transactions`              | All transactions   | Home, Accounting, Cashflow, Stats, all Panels |
| 2   | `/api/data/read/subscriptions`             | All subscriptions  | Subscription page, auto-processing            |
| 3   | `/api/data/read/income/revenue/revenues`   | Revenue items      | Income, Cashflow                              |
| 4   | `/api/data/read/income/revenue/interests`  | Interest items     | Income, Cashflow                              |
| 5   | `/api/data/read/income/revenue/properties` | Property items     | Income, Cashflow                              |
| 6   | `/api/data/read/income/expenses/daily`     | Daily expenses     | Daily, Cashflow                               |
| 7   | `/api/data/read/income/expenses/splurge`   | Splurge expenses   | Splurge, Cashflow                             |
| 8   | `/api/data/read/income/expenses/smile`     | Smile expenses     | Smile, Cashflow                               |
| 9   | `/api/data/read/income/expenses/fire`      | Fire expenses      | Fire, Cashflow                                |
| 10  | `/api/data/read/income/expenses/mojo`      | Mojo expenses      | Fire component                                |
| 11  | `/api/data/read/balance/asset/assets`      | Assets             | Balance                                       |
| 12  | `/api/data/read/balance/asset/shares`      | Shares             | Balance                                       |
| 13  | `/api/data/read/balance/asset/investments` | Investments        | Balance                                       |
| 14  | `/api/data/read/balance/liabilities`       | Liabilities        | Balance, Grow                                 |
| 15  | `/api/data/read/smile`                     | Smile projects     | Smile projects page                           |
| 16  | `/api/data/read/fire`                      | Fire emergencies   | Fire emergencies page                         |
| 17  | `/api/data/read/mojo`                      | Mojo target/amount | Fire component                                |
| 18  | `/api/data/read/budget`                    | Budget entries     | Budget, Plan                                  |
| 19  | `/api/data/read/grow`                      | Grow projects      | Grow page                                     |

**Each request goes through:** TCP handshake → JWT verification → CouchDB document read → JSON serialization → response. On a Raspberry Pi, that's **19× the overhead** of a single read.

**Critical fact:** All 19 paths read from the **same single CouchDB document** (`users/{userId}`). We're making 19 HTTP calls to read different nested properties of one document. The backend reads the full document every time and extracts the requested path.

### 1.2 Deployment Stack Overhead

The current Docker/K8s stack runs **6 containers** on the Raspberry Pi:

| Container             | Memory (K8s limit) | CPU (K8s limit) | Always needed?      |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| **CouchDB**           | 512Mi              | 500m            | YES                 |
| **Backend (Node.js)** | 256Mi × 2 replicas | 200m × 2        | YES (but 1 replica) |
| **Frontend (Nginx)**  | 128Mi × 2 replicas | 100m × 2        | YES (but 1 replica) |
| **Loki**              | unlimited          | unlimited       | NO — debugging only |
| **Promtail**          | unlimited          | unlimited       | NO — debugging only |
| **Grafana**           | unlimited          | unlimited       | NO — debugging only |

**Total baseline:** ~1.5GB+ memory consumed. The Pi 4 has **4GB RAM with no swap**.  
**With logging disabled:** ~638MB — nearly halving resource usage and leaving 1.7GB headroom.

### 1.3 Additional Performance Issues

1. **No response compression** — Nginx config has `sendfile on` but no `gzip` directives for API proxy responses. Large transaction arrays sent uncompressed.
2. **Client-side per-field decryption** — Every field of every record decrypted individually in a `for` loop. 500 transactions = 3000 `decrypt()` calls.
3. **`visibilitychange` triggers full reload** — Every time user tabs back, all 19 requests fire again.
4. **Rate limiter overhead** — 100 req/15min rate limiter runs even when `SKIP_RATE_LIMIT` not set in Docker, adding middleware processing.
5. **CacheService has 5-min TTL but cache is cleared on every `loadFromDB()`** — `database.clearReadCache()` is called first, defeating the cache purpose on reload.
6. **No batch-read endpoint** — A `/api/data/write/batch` exists for writes, but there's no batch-read equivalent. The `GET /api/data/document` endpoint exists and returns the entire document but is unused by the frontend.
7. **2 replicas of frontend + backend** in K8s — unnecessary for a single-user Raspberry Pi. Doubles memory usage.
8. **Helmet, CORS, body-parser (10MB), Winston logging middleware** all run on every request — adds CPU overhead on a constrained device.

## 2. Architecture Redesign Strategy

### 2.1 Tiered Data Loading (The Big Win)

Replace the 19-request eager-load with a **3-tier loading strategy**:

#### Tier 1 — Critical Path (blocks UI, loaded on startup)

Loaded immediately on auth. User sees the app **only after these resolve**.

| Data                                                    | Reason                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `transactions`                                          | Powers Home, Accounting, all expense views, statistics |
| `subscriptions`                                         | Needed for subscription processing before UI renders   |
| `income/revenue/*` (revenues, interests, properties)    | Powers income statement recalculation                  |
| `income/expenses/*` (daily, splurge, smile, fire, mojo) | Powers Home page percentage display                    |

**Implementation:** Single new backend endpoint `GET /api/data/read/batch` that accepts a list of paths and returns all in ONE CouchDB document read + ONE HTTP response.

#### Tier 2 — Deferred (loaded async after UI renders, non-blocking)

Loaded after UI is visible. Data appears as it arrives. User can interact immediately.

| Data                 | Reason                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `smile` (projects)   | Only needed on Smile Projects page   |
| `fire` (emergencies) | Only needed on Fire Emergencies page |
| `mojo`               | Only needed on Fire component        |
| `budget`             | Only needed on Budget/Plan page      |

**Implementation:** Loaded via a second batch-read call after Tier 1 resolves. Components show a skeleton/spinner until data arrives.

#### Tier 3 — On-Demand (loaded when user navigates to the page)

Only fetched when the user actually opens the relevant page.

| Data                        | Reason                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `grow` (projects)           | Complex object, only on Grow page, rarely visited |
| `balance/asset/assets`      | Only on Balance page                              |
| `balance/asset/shares`      | Only on Balance page                              |
| `balance/asset/investments` | Only on Balance page                              |
| `balance/liabilities`       | Only on Balance + Grow page                       |

**Implementation:** Components trigger a load on `ngOnInit()` if data isn't already in AppState. New `AppDataService.loadOnDemand(paths[])` method.

#### Expected Impact

| Scenario                       | Before                      | After (estimate)                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Initial page load (HTTP calls) | 19 requests                 | 1 request (Tier 1 batch)                 |
| Time to interactive            | 2-3+ seconds                | < 1 second target                        |
| Subsequent page loads          | 19 requests (cache cleared) | 0 (use cached AppState + localStorage)   |
| Tab-back reload                | 19 requests                 | 1 request (Tier 1 only, Tier 2/3 cached) |

### 2.2 New Backend Endpoint: Batch Read

```
POST /api/data/read/batch
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: { "paths": ["transactions", "subscriptions", "income/revenue/revenues", ...] }
Response: { "transactions": [...], "subscriptions": [...], ... }
```

**Implementation detail:** Backend reads the user's CouchDB document ONCE, extracts requested paths, returns them all in one response. This turns 19 CouchDB reads into 1.

### 2.3 Smarter Reload on Visibility Change

Replace the full 19-request reload with:

1. Check a lightweight `GET /api/data/read/updatedAt` timestamp
2. If `updatedAt > local timestamp` → reload Tier 1 only
3. If unchanged → skip reload entirely (data is already fresh)

### 2.4 Response Compression

Add gzip compression to Nginx for API proxy responses:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types application/json text/plain;
gzip_min_length 1024;
gzip_proxied any;
```

Transaction arrays can be 50-200KB+ — gzip typically achieves 80-90% compression on JSON.

### 2.5 Bulk Decryption Optimization

Current: Per-field `decrypt()` in a loop (N records × M fields = N×M calls).  
Proposed: Batch decrypt function that processes the entire array server-side or in a single optimized pass. Consider moving decryption to the backend (return decrypted data over HTTPS) to offload the browser.

---

## 3. Deployment Stack Optimization

### 3.1 Minimal Stack (Default)

The default self-hosted deployment should only run **3 containers**:

| Container | Purpose     | Required |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| CouchDB   | Database    | YES      |
| Backend   | API         | YES      |
| Frontend  | Nginx + SPA | YES      |

### 3.2 Debug Stack (On-Demand)

Loki, Promtail, and Grafana should be in a **separate docker-compose override** or behind a flag:

```bash
# Normal operation (minimal resources)
docker-compose up -d

# When debugging is needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.logging.yml up -d

# Done debugging, free resources
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.logging.yml down
# Then: docker-compose up -d
```

### 3.3 K8s Resource Right-Sizing

| Container             | Current                | Proposed                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Backend               | 2 replicas, 256Mi each | **1 replica**, 192Mi    |
| Frontend              | 2 replicas, 128Mi each | **1 replica**, 96Mi     |
| CouchDB               | 1 replica, 512Mi       | 1 replica, **384Mi**    |
| Loki/Promtail/Grafana | Always on              | **Disabled by default** |

**Estimated total memory:** ~672Mi down from ~1.5GB+ (55% reduction)

### 3.4 Backend Middleware Optimization

For Raspberry Pi, strip unnecessary middleware:

- **Remove Helmet** in production behind reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik already sets headers)
- **Remove rate limiter** when `SKIP_RATE_LIMIT=true` (already supported, ensure it's default in Pi config)
- **Reduce body-parser limit** from 10MB to 2MB (realistic for personal finance data)
- **Conditional logging** — reduce Winston log level to `warn` in production; verbose logging only in debug mode

---

## 4. Firebase Considerations

Firebase mode is performant — **no changes needed now**. However, the Tier 1/2/3 refactor in `AppDataService.loadFromDB()` should be done with **both modes in mind**:

- The `DatabaseService` abstraction already branches on `environment.mode`
- The batch-read endpoint is selfhosted-only; Firebase uses its native batching
- For Firebase: the same tiered `Promise` grouping can be applied (Tier 1 first, Tier 2 after, Tier 3 on-demand) — this won't hurt Firebase performance but keeps the code unified
- **Recommendation:** Implement the tiered loading in a mode-agnostic way. If Firebase performance ever degrades, the architecture is already in place.

---

## 5. Server Diagnostics Needed

To properly size the optimizations, we need the following from the Raspberry Pi:

### Collected Diagnostics (2026-03-29)

| Metric                | Value                                              | Assessment                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Pi model**          | Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB RAM                            | Mid-range — workable                       |
| **Memory**            | 3.7Gi total, 1.4Gi used (OS only), 2.3Gi available | Tight when 6 containers run (~1.5GB+)      |
| **Disk**              | 117GB SSD, 11% used (101GB free)                   | **SSD — not the bottleneck**               |
| **Temperature**       | 38.9°C                                             | Cool, no thermal throttling                |
| **Containers**        | None running at time of check (Podman)             | Need to measure under load                 |
| **Swap**              | **NONE configured**                                | **RISK: OOM kill if memory exceeds 3.7GB** |
| **Container runtime** | **Podman** (not Docker)                            | Deployment scripts need `podman-compose`   |

**Critical insight:** With no swap and only 2.3GB free (OS idle), running 6 containers (CouchDB 512Mi + Backend 256Mi×2 + Frontend 128Mi×2 + Loki + Promtail + Grafana) will push memory to the limit. This confirms the logging stack MUST be disabled by default.

**Revised memory budget (with logging disabled, 1 replica each):**

| Container        | Budget          |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| CouchDB          | ~350Mi          |
| Backend          | ~192Mi          |
| Frontend (Nginx) | ~96Mi           |
| **Total app**    | **~638Mi**      |
| OS baseline      | ~1.4Gi          |
| **Grand total**  | **~2.0Gi**      |
| **Headroom**     | **~1.7Gi free** |

With logging enabled it would be ~2.5Gi+ leaving <1.2Gi free — risky for spikes.

### Still Needed (measure when containers are running)

- [ ] **CouchDB document size:** `curl http://localhost:5984/users` (the `disk_size` field)
- [ ] **Number of transactions** for a typical user (rough count)
- [ ] **Backend response time** under load: `curl -w "%{time_total}" http://localhost:3000/api/data/read/transactions -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."`
- [ ] **Podman stats under load:** `podman stats --no-stream` while app is running
- [ ] Consider adding 1GB swap file as safety net: `sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile && sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile`

---

## 7. Action Items — Prioritized Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (No Architecture Change) — Est. Low Risk

- [x] **1.0** Add 1GB swap file on the Pi as OOM safety net (`fallocate + mkswap + swapon + fstab`)
  - Run on Pi: `sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile && sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile`
  - Persist: `echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab`
- [x] **1.1** Split `docker-compose.yml` into base + logging overlay → immediately free ~800MB RAM
  - Created `docker-compose.logging.yml` overlay
  - Base `docker-compose.yml` now runs only CouchDB + Backend + Frontend
- [x] **1.2** Reduce K8s replicas to 1 for frontend + backend
  - `k8s/backend.yaml`: 2 → 1 replica, memory limit 256Mi → 192Mi
  - `k8s/frontend.yaml`: 2 → 1 replica, memory limit 128Mi → 96Mi
- [x] **1.3** Add gzip compression to `nginx.conf` for API responses
  - Added `gzip on` with `application/json`, `text/plain`, `application/javascript`, `text/css`
- [x] **1.4** Set backend `LOG_LEVEL=warn` in production config
  - `docker-compose.yml`: added `LOG_LEVEL=warn` + `SKIP_RATE_LIMIT=true`
  - `k8s/backend.yaml`: added `LOG_LEVEL: "warn"` to ConfigMap + env mapping
  - Logging overlay overrides to `LOG_LEVEL=info` when debugging
- [x] **1.5** Reduce body-parser limit from 10MB to 2MB
  - `backend/server.js`: `express.json` and `express.text` limits 10mb → 2mb
- [x] **1.6** Verify Podman compatibility — deploy scripts already use Podman + K8s
  - `deploy-local.ps1` and `deploy.sh` already use `podman` for builds
  - `docker-compose.yml` format is Podman-compatible (`podman-compose` reads it natively)
- [ ] **1.7** Collect remaining diagnostics (CouchDB doc size, response times) once containers are running

### Phase 2: Backend Batch Read — The Big Win

- [x] **2.1** Implement `POST /api/data/read/batch` endpoint in `backend/routes/data.js`
  - Reads CouchDB doc ONCE, extracts all requested paths, returns in single response
  - Validates: array required, non-empty, max 50 paths, skips non-strings
  - Returns `{ data: { path: value, ... }, updatedAt: "..." }`
  - Graceful 404 handling (returns nulls for all paths if user doc missing)
- [x] **2.2** Write backend unit + integration tests for batch-read
  - 14 unit tests (mocked DB): `backend/tests/unit/batch-read.test.js`
  - 10 integration tests (real CouchDB): `backend/tests/integration/batch-read.test.js`
  - Covers: happy path, nested paths, missing paths, auth, validation, tier-1 all-at-once, consistency with individual reads, updatedAt behavior
- [x] **2.3** Add `GET /api/data/updatedAt` lightweight endpoint + `updatedAt` in batch response
  - `GET /api/data/updatedAt` — returns only `{ updatedAt }`, no data payload
  - Batch-read response includes `updatedAt` in every response
  - Tests verify: timestamp updates on write, NOT on read

### Phase 3: Frontend Tiered Loading — Architecture Change

- [x] **3.1** Refactor `AppDataService.loadFromDB()` into `loadTier1()`, `loadTier2()`, `loadTier3OnDemand(paths[])`
- [x] **3.2** `loadTier1()` calls batch-read with critical paths → blocks UI
- [x] **3.3** `loadTier2()` called after Tier 1 resolves → non-blocking, updates components
- [x] **3.4** Add `loadOnDemand()` to `AppDataService` → called by Grow, Balance components on `ngOnInit()`
- [x] **3.5** Add loading/skeleton state to Tier 2 and Tier 3 components
- [x] **3.6** Refactor `visibilitychange` handler: check `updatedAt` → only reload Tier 1 if changed
- [x] **3.7** Update all frontend unit tests for new loading behavior
- [x] **3.8** Keep Firebase mode working — test both modes

### Phase 4: Additional Optimizations

- [x] **4.1** ~~Evaluate moving decryption to backend~~ — **Skipped:** keeping client-side encryption preserves zero-knowledge architecture (server never sees plaintext)
- [x] **4.2** Add ETags or `If-None-Match` support on backend reads for caching
- [x] **4.3** ~~Consider backend-side income statement recalculation~~ — **Skipped:** requires server-side decryption, conflicts with zero-knowledge model
- [x] **4.4** Optimize CouchDB: auto-compaction config, connection limits, max doc size

### Phase 5: QA Validation & Testing

- [x] **5.1** Write all new tests from Section 6.1
- [x] **5.2** Update existing tests from Section 6.2
- [x] **5.3** Implement performance regression tests from Section 6.3
- [ ] **5.4** Full E2E test run in selfhosted mode on actual Raspberry Pi hardware

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk                                                    | Impact                   | Mitigation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch-read endpoint returns too much data               | Slow response            | Paths are explicit — only requested data returned           |
| Tier 3 components show empty state before navigation    | Minor UX issue           | Skeleton loading states with smooth transition              |
| Firebase mode breaks during refactor                    | Users lose access        | Test both modes at every step; Firebase paths kept separate |
| CouchDB runs out of memory on Pi                        | App crashes              | Reduced to 350Mi; **add 1GB swap file as safety net**       |
| No swap configured                                      | OOM kill on memory spike | Add swap file before deploying (Phase 1)                    |
| localStorage grows too large                            | Browser quota hit        | Already encrypted; consider TTL cleanup for old data        |
| Decryption move to backend exposes plaintext in transit | Security                 | Only over HTTPS; encryption at rest in CouchDB preserved    |
